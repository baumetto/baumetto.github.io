      <h2>Welcome! 🤝</h2>
      <p> 
        <strong>Hello!</strong> I am <strong>Michele</strong> and I welcome you to my <strong>homepage</strong>! <br>
        I use this page to <strong>keep track</strong> of <strong>my work</strong> and <strong>my achievements</strong>. <br>
        Keep in mind there is still some <strong>work in progress</strong>... <br>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> 
        I am a <strong>Staff Hardware Design Engineer</strong> at <strong>STMicroelectronics</strong> (<strong>Milan, Italy</strong>) with a keen interest in <strong>disruptive</strong> and <strong>emerging technologies</strong> such as <strong>Heterogeneous Integration</strong>, <strong>Neuromorphic Computing</strong>, and <strong>Quantum Computing</strong>.<br>
        My research focuses on <strong>reconfigurable</strong>, <strong>streaming-based</strong> architectures of <strong>In-Memory Neural Processing Units</strong> (IMNPUs) to accelerate <strong>Generative AI</strong> and <strong>Deep Learning</strong> at the Edge. <br>
        Oddly enough, I started my career in a <strong>completely different</strong> sector: for <strong>two years</strong> I lived in <strong>Udine (Italy)</strong>, developing <strong>rear-lamp electronics</strong> for <strong>Magneti Marelli</strong> in the <strong>automotive industry</strong>. <br>
        In my <strong>- little -</strong> spare time I enjoy <strong>way too many</strong> hobbies, but mainly <strong>videogames/board games</strong> and <strong>music</strong>. <br>
        I am <strong>31 years old</strong> as I write and was actually born in the <strong>south of Italy</strong>.

            <h3 class="about-title">About me</h3>
            <p class="about-content">
                I am a Staff Hardware Design Engineer at STMicroelectronics (Milan, Italy) with a keen interest in disruptive and emerging technologies such as Heterogeneous Integration, Neuromorphic Computing, and Quantum Computing.
                My research focuses on reconfigurable, streaming-based architectures of In-Memory Neural Processing Units (IMNPUs) to accelerate Generative AI and Deep Learning at the Edge.
                Oddly enough, I started my career in a completely different sector: for two years I lived in Udine (Italy), developing rear-lamp electronics for Magneti Marelli in the automotive industry.
                In my - little - spare time I enjoy way too many hobbies, but mainly videogames/board games and music.
                I am 31 years old as I write and was actually born in the south of Italy.
